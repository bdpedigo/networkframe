A <code>NetworkFrame</code> object is simply a table representing nodes and a table representing edges, and a variety of methods to make querying and manipulating that data easy.</p> <p>Pros:</p> <ul> <li>Lightweight: <code>NetworkFrame</code> objects are just two DataFrames, so they're easy to manipulate and integrate with other tools.</li> <li>Interoperable: can output to <code>NetworkX</code>, <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> sparse matrices, and other formats (coming soon).</li> <li>Flexible: can represent directed, undirected, and multigraphs.</li> <li>Familiar: if you're familiar with <code>Pandas</code> <code>DataFrames</code>, that is. As much as possible, <code>networkframe</code> uses the same syntax as <code>Pandas</code>, but also just gives you access to the underlying tables.</li> <li>Extensible: it's easy to use <code>NetworkFrame</code> as a base graph - for instance, you could make a <code>SpatialNetworkFrame</code> that adds spatial information to the nodes and edges.</li> </ul> <p>Cons:</p> <ul> <li>No guarantees: since <code>networkframe</code> gives you access to the underlying <code>DataFrames</code>, it doesn't do much validation of the data.</li> <li>Not optimized for graph computations: since <code>networkframe</code> is storing data as simple node and edge tables, it's not optimized for doing actual computations on those graphs (e.g. like searching for shortest paths). A typical workflow would be to use <code>networkframe</code> to load and manipulate your data, then convert to a more graph-oriented format like <code>scipy</code> sparse matrices or <code>NetworkX</code> for computations.</li> </ul> <p>Room for improvement:</p> <ul> <li>Early development: there are likely bugs and missing features. Please report any issues you find!</li> <li>More interoperability: <code>networkframe</code> can currently output to <code>NetworkX</code>, <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> sparse matrices, and other formats (coming soon). It would be nice to be able to read in from these formats as well.</li> <li>Graph-type handling: <code>networkframe</code> has mainly been tested on directed graphs, less so for undirected and multigraphs.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>This package was created with Cookiecutter and the bdpedigo/cookiecutter-pypackage project template (which builds on several previous versions).</p>"},{"location":"api/","title":"Modules","text":"<p>Top-level package for networkframe.</p>"},{"location":"changelog/","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#v031-2023-12-14","title":"v0.3.1 (2023-12-14)","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#fix","title":"Fix","text":"<ul> <li>fix improper commitizen spec</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#v030-2023-12-14","title":"v0.3.0 (2023-12-14)","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#v021-2023-12-13","title":"v0.2.1 (2023-12-13)","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#v020-2023-12-13","title":"v0.2.0 (2023-12-13)","text":""},{"location":"contributing/","title":"Contributing","text":""},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
